# ❤️ Day 2 — Heart Disease Risk Prediction App

This project focuses on predicting the risk of heart disease using patient medical data.  
The goal is not just to predict, but also to understand **why** the model makes a decision.

## 🎯 What this project will do

- Predict probability of heart disease
- Classify risk as Low / Medium / High
- Show important medical factors affecting prediction
- Provide simple and clean medical-style UI

## 📊 Dataset

UCI Heart Disease Dataset  
Contains patient health records with features like:
- age
- cholesterol
- blood pressure
- ECG results
- chest pain type

Target:
- 0 → No heart disease
- 1 → Heart disease present
